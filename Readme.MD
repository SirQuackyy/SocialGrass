<div id = "text" align= 'center'> Never be lonely again! We'll bring the friends to you.</div>

### What does it do?
Frinder allows high schoolers to create an account and enter a global chatroom with other high schoolers around the country. You can create a profile with an about me and a list of interests to meet other high schoolers with similar interests, allowing you to make friends more easily.

### Inspiration
We were inspired by the loneliness one of our team mates had felt before having met the rest of us, which led us to come up with the idea of Frinder where only teenagers could access it and could interact with each other freely from across the country. We wanted to make sure nobody was lonely and that everyone had friends, so we drew inspiration from Tinder due to us having seen some memes regarding Tinder, we decided to name it after Tinder, but instead of finding love we find you friends.

### How we built it
We utilized HTML, CSS and BootStrap to develop our beautiful front end, while behind the scenes JavaScript, Node.js and multiple Rest APIS carried us in the backend. Using a combination of JSON and Node.js we were able to create an efficient database that can catalog account information and recall it whenever a user tries sign in.

### Challenges we faced
We were using Node.js for the back end which did not work well with the client side aspect of the hack. One example is not being able use regular database so we made our own. We didn't know how to integrate MongoDB into our website, so we used Node.js, which led to us struggling to connect both ends of our database.

### Accomplishments that we're proud of
We were efficiently able to divide up the work allowing each of us to work in our strong suits and make a product we were are all proud of. Individual accomplishments are developing a database, a chat bot and a global chat room.

### What we learned
We learned how to work as a team and be efficient as well as to be realistic with our goals.

### What's next for Frinder?
We will implement a personal DM system so you can stay in contact with friends you meet on the global chat. Additionally, we will add a matching function that will match you with others with similar interests.
